# Lava Rising Datapack for Minecraft 1.17

A lightweight and easy-to-use datapack that makes the lava rise from the bottom of the world to the top, forcing players to build up and attack, or get engulfed by the lava. You have one life, once you die, you're out and left to spectate the game. The last player remaining wins!

## Featuring

* **Customisable timings**: Using scoreboards you can configure event timings to fit your liking.
* **Sectioned game**: The game is structured into 3 segments; the starter, grace and main period.
* **Dead spectators**: Once out of the grace period, dead players are automatically spectating.
* **Height limiting**: Upon the lava reaching y245, it's up to the players to fight to the death and steal the victory.
* **Minimal layout**: Any game status updates are contained in a single bossbar to ensure the screen has minimal interruptions.
* **Handled lag**: To ensure the game runs smooth all the time, all falling blocks are automatically killed.
* **Simplified setup**: A simple setup flow will help you with your event upon adding the datapack.
